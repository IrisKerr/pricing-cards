## What I used

- Tailwind CSS
- HTML
- Font Awesome

## Personal comments

- I didn't use the SVG files proposed in the course. I prefered to use icons from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library instead.
- I designed the cards a bit smaller and changed the initial breakpoints from "medium" to "larger" screen because the flex-row didn't render as hoped on tablet size (>768px).
